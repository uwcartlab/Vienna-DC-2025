# 2025 SDG Design Challenge / T/U(X)W

## Welcome to the 2025 Design Challenge!

The University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab ([Cart Lab](https://www.geography.wisc.edu/cartography)) Design Challenge is a day-long mapping workshop that brings together Cartography and Geography students, often in collaboration with campus or community partners, around a curated mapping theme. The Design Challenge is now an institution in the University of Wisconsin‒Madison Geography Department, first running in 2015 and wrapping its 10th annual event this past February 2024. This year (officially #DC11) we are taking the Design Challenge international, combining efforts with the Technical University of Wien, the Erasmus Mundus MSc Cartography Programme, and the International Cartographic Association Commission on the User Experience (UX).

Specifically, we will be making a collective atlas of the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) ... _in less than one week_! The UN adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, an expansion from the prior 2000–2015 Millennium Development Goals, and defined a global indicator framework for collective transformation and action toward a more equitable and just world. At the time of this writing (October 2024), the SDG global indicator framework comprised 17 goals to address the most pressing problems facing our worlds, 169 targets that prescribe real and actionable outcomes for sustainability, and 231 unique indicators used to measure and monitor progress towards these targets, inform policy at global and local levels, and promote accountability across all stakeholders (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/). 

## Prompt: SDG Atlas in a Week

Our SDG Atlas in a Week will include at least 17 two page spreads, one covering each of the SDGs plus some from front and back matter. Each spread will include one page for maps, charts, and clarifying annotation about the SDG and a second page providing a title and statement about what the maps are saying and what this means for our planet's future and our individual actions. You will work in a small team to develop one of the atlas spreads, but in addition to mapping SDG indicator data, we also want you to bring your own personal experiences and home locations into the map, telling a _compelling story_ about your team's common ground around the SDG and the alternatives that are possible from your different, worldwide perspectives.
 
## Schedule 

The DC Schedule is broken into six 90-120 minute units spanning three days, with most scheduled activities on Monday, May 12th, and drafts submitted 24 hours after the final unit on Thursday, May 15th. The schedule also includes a PhD student meetup (open to MSc students, particularly those interested in a PhD) and two social opportunities for conversation and networking (Wednesday and Thursday)

## Data Sources
* [UN SDG Data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database) - Global attribute data based on SDG indicators.
* [Simplified Country Shapefile](/Data/Spatial-Data/UN_Countries_Simplified.zip) - A processed and generalized shapefile of global nations. Can be easily joined with the UN SDG attribute data. From the [UN GeoPortal](https://geoportal.un.org/arcgis/apps/sites/#/geohub/datasets/d7caaff3ef4b4f7c82689b7c4694ad92/about).
* [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) - A global geospatial reference database. Includes physical, cultural/political, and raster data at three different scales. A great resource for creating basemaps.  
* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - Volunteer-created global GIS reference database. Data can be downloaded through the [Overpass API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) or through the [QuickOSM Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/) for QGIS.
* [GIS Data Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GIS_data_sources#Europe_by_country) - Helpful Wikipedia list of some national and regional GIS data sources.
* [Open Africa](https://open.africa/) - Volunteer-led open GIS data platform centered on Africa. 
* [Latin America Data Hub](https://hub-latin-america-geocentro.hub.arcgis.com/) - Geospatial HUB for SDG related data centered on Latin America.
* [Data for Polar Regions](https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/gisdata/polardata) - Hub for data resources about Antarctica and the Arctic. Hosted at Dartmouth University.
* [Digital India](https://www.data.gov.in/) - Open geospatial data platform for India.

Many nations across the globe have some geospatial and attribute data available through national-level portals. Some sub-natinoal regions and cities do, too (for example [Cape Town](https://odp-cctegis.opendata.arcgis.com/), [Vienna](https://www.wien.gv.at/viennagis/), [Rio de Janeiro](https://www.data.rio/)). As you develop your idea/map, you are encouraged to search for  data from a local nation/region/city to complement your global data, and tell a grounded, place-based narrative. 

Data from any official government source is limited. Combining different sources, and (if possible) qualitative and quantitative data, can enrich your map's story.
